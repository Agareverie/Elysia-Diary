# **Java Diary - Day 1**

- Installed IntelliJ, OpenJDK and Gradle on Blackstone-Deck and Calcite-Deck
- Made simple functions like `print()` and `range()`
- Learn how to use Gradle to run Java code
- Learned `Optional` because I don't want to deal with `NullPointerException`

> [!tip]
> - When installing Java to a Windows device, first download the Binary-Only OpenJDK 23, then Extract the folder, after that, put the JDK folder inside the C:/Program Files/Java folder, next, add the `bin` folder to the PATH environment variable, finally, create a new environment variable, JAVA_HOME, containing the root (Not `bin`) folder of the JDK.
> - When installing Java to a MacOS device, follow similar instructions, note that you only need to `export $PATH` to the `bin` folder, without the need to create JAVA_HOME.
> - Gradle, a Java Build tool, follows a similar installation process on Windows, exporting the `bin` files to the PATH. However, in MacOS, Gradle can be installed using `brew`.
