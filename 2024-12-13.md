# **Java Diary - Day 3**

- Fixed up the Event listeners and controls for the Mario Clone
- Fiddled with Inheritance, went back to Composition
- Added the Mario music (Will replace with my FL studio version once I get things figured out)
- At dorms, I fiddled with Java on Calcite-Deck learning something non-GUI related
- I ended up learning XCharts in Java and was able to create graphs
- Created wrapper classes to make XCharts more like Matplotlib

> When programming in Java, always take note of IOExceptions when operating with files. Default file getting can also not work if the file is null. To fix, use `Objects.requireNonNull()` and catch the `NullPointerException`.
