# **Java Diary - Day 2**

-  At mom’s workplace, installed OpenJDK and Gradle on Marble-Cell 
- Fiddled with `gradle init` because I can’t use IntelliJ here so I have to use Java in VSCode for the first time
- Learn that the Java debugger extensions in VSCode suck so I just use `gradle run` for everything
- Created a mockup Mario Clone using Java Swing where Mario is a red square that can run and jump within the box
- Learned how to use Resources folder and basics of Java File I/O
- Lose half the progress because Marble-Cell doesn’t have Git installed
- Recreated the Mario clone in Blackstone-Deck and IntelliJ after arriving at dorms

> [!tip]
> Any class in the main package can access the resources folder, to use, call `ClassName.class.getResource('/filePath')`, note the `/` before the filePath.
